# Learning Playground Repository

This repository serves as a collection of homework assignments and code related to exercises done in class. It's a sandbox where I explore different programming concepts, practice coding, and learn new ways of writing modern Java code. I document my progress and store my code here.

## Language Usage
Please note that the code in this repository might contain a mix of Spanish and English. This is because some of my professors request code to be written in Spanish. However, I try to provide comments and documentation in English whenever possible to make the code more accessible to a wider audience.

## Contribution
Feel free to explore the contents of this repository! While it primarily serves as a personal learning space, you may find something interesting if you dig deep enough. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or corrections, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are always welcome!

Happy coding!
